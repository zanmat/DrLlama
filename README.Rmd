# DocToRLlama (DrLlama)

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The Documentation-To-R (DocToR) package uses Large Language Models to provide documentation on undocumented R code, improving the readability of code written by others (or by you a long time ago).

## Installation

You can install the development version of DrLlama from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("zanmat/DrLlama")
```

DrLlama requires having [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) installed and running.
